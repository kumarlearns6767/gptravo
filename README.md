# gptravo

This is a Travel Agency website for my portfolio in Travel Agencies Websites Category. This website was initially made for my client "GP Travo" and later on modified to make the requirements as shared in the feedback with the client and also to convert the basic static landing page into working website which is capable to do financial transactions. So, I decided to learn and add more required features to this website to make it functional and interactive.

Steps to run this website on your local computer (windows specific) -

1. Git clone the URL of this repository and try cloning the repository though GIT bash or terminal in your local machine.

2.

A Travel Company Landing Page which has 6 sections - Home, Services, Packages, Destinations, Newsletter/Contact Us, Footer. This landing page is made to generate leads through the website, answer user inquiries, let the user contact the company for placing an order, learn about company services in detail and make purchase decisions according.
