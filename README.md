This is a Travel Agency website for my portfolio in Travel Agencies Websites Category. This website was initially made for my client "GP Travo" and later on modified to make the requirements as shared in the feedback with the client and also to convert the basic static landing page into working website which is capable to do financial transactions. So, I decided to learn and add more required features to this website to make it functional and interactive.

Steps to run this website on your local computer (windows specific) -

1. Git clone the URL of this repository and try cloning the repository through GIT bash or terminal in your local machine.

2. After cloning, open the repository in your favorite code editor/IDE (I made this in VS Code so I suggest VS Code but not mandatory).

3. Navigate to the project explorer of your code editor and click on "index.html" file.

4. After Opening the "index.html" file, here is the explanation of the work done inside the "index.html" file -

   > html language is english as mentioned in line no 2.

   > Boxi Icons are imported and used from line no 8 to 15.

   >
