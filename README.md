# GP TRAVO Agency Landing Page

This is a Travel Agency website for my portfolio in Travel Agencies Websites Category. This website was initially made for my client "GP Travo" and later on modified according to the requirements as shared in the feedback from the client and also to convert the basic static landing page into working website which is capable to do financial transactions. So, I decided to learn and add more required features to this website to make it functional and interactive.
